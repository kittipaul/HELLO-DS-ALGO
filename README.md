# HELLO-DS-ALGO

I remembered the first time I start to learn coding, "HELLO WORLD!" is always the thing that we want to print out to the console :)

When you know how to code, the next step will be learn how to code it more clean and efficient. And here comes "HELLO-DS-ALGO".

I make this repo to keep learning Data Structure and Algorithm, also sharing to the community. Hope it could help people who just starting to code or who loves problem-solving. 

Happy Coding!! :]
